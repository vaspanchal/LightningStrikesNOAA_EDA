## Git Tracking .gitignore file fixed
it was doing so coz .gitignore only ignores intracked files but the csv was already tracked and since it was very large in size, it caused issue

## fix
ðŸ”¹ 1. Remove the file from Gitâ€™s history (but keep it locally)

Run:

git rm --cached "archive/lightening strikes dataset.csv"

ðŸ”¹ 2. Commit the change
git commit -m "Remove large dataset file from repo"

Step 1: Install git filter-repo (recommended)

If you donâ€™t have it:

Linux/macOS:

pip install git-filter-repo

git filter-repo --path "archive/lightening strikes dataset.csv" --invert-paths --force
git push origin main --force
